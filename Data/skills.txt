I hold a B.Sc. and B.Hons. in Physics from the University of Cape Town, followed by an M.Sc. and now a nearly completed Ph.D. in Computational Physics.

My M.Sc. focused on developing a time-of-flight PEPT tracking algorithm for detecting turbulent flow patterns which combined medical imaging techniques with computational physics.

My Ph.D. research has centered around algorithm development, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning applications for particle tracking. I've built high-performance data pipelines in Python and C++, automated complex simulation workflows using Geant4/GATE, and mentored junior researchers across institutions including Imperial College London and iThemba LABS.

This work has involved extensive use of statistical modeling, signal processing, and optimization techniques â€” all of which have strong overlap with modern data and software engineering practices.

Throughout my studies, I focused on courses and projects that emphasized computational methods, mathematical modeling, and data-driven problem solving.
